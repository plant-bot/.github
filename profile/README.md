## Description

Plant bot is a plant monitoring system designed to scale alongside an Arduino project, as well as integrate with personal organization tools like Notion. A plant monitoring system is a common project for tech / plant lovers and allows people to expirament with Arduino electrical engineering, as well as full-stack development. This project is no different.

That being said, I wanted to design a system that mimics the way plants express their "feelings," or how they communicate the data they collect to us. As any plant-lover knows; yellow and droopy leaves could mean _anything_. Issues can be light-levels, temperature of soil, soil compacting, low nutrients, low humidity, overwatering, underwatering, a natural decaying process, **root rot,** or just because they dislike you.

The plant bot should display relevant info at a glance while allowing the user to dive deeper into trends, and integrate into organization tools so you don't have to even think to open it.
